When I first heard about the Figma Design Competition for Cincinnati Design Week, I was excited but also a bit hesitant. The challenge was to design a full website in just 30 minutes using a basic wireframe they’d provide. We’d get a few photo assets and some inspiration, but that was it. A fast-paced design sprint at UC’s Innovation Hub sounded intense. It was my first time entering any kind of design competition, and knowing I’d be up against some seriously skilled designers made me question if I was ready. Imposter syndrome hit me hard that evening, but I submitted my application anyway.

Walking into the Innovation Hub, my stomach was doing flips. But as they briefed us on the challenge and the countdown began, something unexpected happened. A strange calm washed over me. There was no time for perfectionism or self-doubt. I just had to trust my instincts. I realized that when you’re under intense time pressure, overthinking isn’t an option. You rely on gut decisions, and in that space, you learn a lot about yourself as a designer.

We had 30 minutes to design a homepage for the event sponsor, Hunited. There was no time for second-guessing or obsessing over tiny details. I had to make quick, confident choices and stay focused on building something that met the brief. Surprisingly, the tight deadline felt freeing. It forced me to focus on what really mattered—creativity, clarity, and user experience. Under that pressure, I stopped worrying about how others were doing and started trusting my own process. By the end, I was proud of what I made, even if I wasn’t sure it would stand out in such a talented crowd.

## A Surreal Win

When they announced the winners and called my name, I was completely shocked. Winning my first-ever design competition felt surreal. It wasn’t just about recognition. It was about trusting my instincts and seeing that approach validated. In those 30 minutes, I learned more about my creative process than I had in countless hours of normal work. It reminded me that when you stop trying to be perfect and just create, you often end up making something special.

Taking part in the challenge taught me that growth happens outside your comfort zone. I didn’t just walk away with a win from Cincinnati Design Week’s Figma competition. I left with a better understanding of who I am as a designer.
