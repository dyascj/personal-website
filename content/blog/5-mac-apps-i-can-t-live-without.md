Hey there! I wanted to share the five Mac apps that have completely changed how I work and play on my Mac.

### [Klack](https://tryklack.com) – $5  
A delightfully silly yet surprisingly useful app that adds mechanical keyboard sounds to your typing. 

I use it with my Bluetooth keyboard and the latency is practically nonexistent. It helps my ADHD brain lock into focus by mimicking those satisfying "thock‑a‑thock" switches. Plus, it's lightweight and fun to use.

### [Void](https://voideditor.com) – Free  
An open‑source Cursor alternative that’s quickly become my coding go‑to. I couldn’t handle another subscription, so Void’s fully local AI editing (you can plug in any model) is a breath of fresh air. Built on VS Code, all your keybindings and themes migrate seamlessly.

### [Figma](https://www.figma.com) – Free (Paid Tier Available)  
No surprises here — Figma’s basically the industry standard. I started with it for digital product design at work, but over the past three years it’s evolved into my one‑stop shop for both print and digital workflows. From UI mockups to brochures or wireframes, it’s the backbone of my creative process.

### [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) – Free (Paid Tier Available)  
My productivity superhero! I needed a Spotlight replacement that could handle my cluttered app folder and countless documents — and Raycast nailed it. With installable plugins and the ability to write your own, it’s the Swiss Army knife of Mac tools. Whenever I get a new Mac, Raycast is the first thing I install.

### [Notion Calendar](https://www.notion.so/product/calendar) – Free (Notion Subscription Available)  
Hands‑down my favorite calendar app. Clean UI, seamless integration with my shared Notion workspace, and intuitive multi–time‑zone support that actually works. It’s everything I need wrapped in minimal design — the icing on my Notion‑powered productivity cake.
