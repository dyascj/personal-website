Say hello to **Pomodorii! 🎉** A Wii-inspired pomodoro timer that leans into joy and whimsy, designed and built end to end by me.

This started as a tiny sound-design playground and grew into one of my favorite builds. The goal is simple: add structure to your day while keeping the energy light and playful.

Pomodorii is a **sound-first UI** experiment that I shipped because it made me smile, and I think it might do the same for you.

## Why I made it

I wanted a timer that feels like booting up a Wii: bright, bubbly, and unpretentious. Building Pomodorii let me play with motion and audio while keeping the product dead simple to use.

## Sound-first UI

Every interaction sounds different: picking up a task, starting the timer, hovering a close button. The UI stays readable by ear, with gentle transitions instead of harsh alarms and subtle motions and gradients that move in time with the cues. There is even a Wii-like themesong baked in because this one is meant to be fun.

## What makes it fun

Rounded cards, soft glass, and cheerful iconography keep things firmly in Wii territory. The layout stays clean so the timer is always the hero and there is no visual noise. Small haptics and micro-motions line up with the soundscape to give those little dopamine hits without getting in the way.

## Tech & design notes

Built with Next.js and React, styled in Tailwind CSS, and animated with Framer Motion, Pomodorii leans on a custom Web Audio setup for its cues and transitions. It ships as a lightweight single-page app so it loads quickly when all you want to do is start a session.
