I just launched my very own pomodoro timer — **Pomodorii! 🎉** Pomodorii captures all the joy and whimsy of early 2000s Nintendo consoles, and is designed + developed entirely by me.

What started as a throwaway side project (mainly an excuse to finally design something with sound) quickly turned into one of my cutest builds ever. I hope Pomodorii brings a little joy (and structure!) to your workflow.

At its core, this was an exploration in **sound design for UI**—and really, that's it. I decided to publish it because I figured it might still provide a little value (and a smile) to people.

## Why I made it

I wanted a timer that felt like booting up a Wii: bright, bubbly, and unpretentious. Building Pomodorii let me indulge in motion + audio play while keeping the product dead simple to use.

## Sound-first UI

- Every interaction sounds different—picking up a task, starting the timer, hovering a close button—so the UI feels alive and readable by ear.
- Gentle transitions instead of harsh alarms to keep flow intact.
- Subtle UI flourishes (micro-animations, gradient glows) that sync with the sound cues.
- There’s a Wii-like themesong baked in because this one’s just meant to be fun.

## What makes it fun

- **Wii-inspired skin:** Rounded cards, soft glass, and cheerful iconography.
- **One-look clarity:** Big session timer, minimal chrome, zero distractions.
- **Little dopamine hits:** Friendly haptics/micro-motions paired with the soundscape.

## Tech & design notes

- Built with Next.js + React, styled in Tailwind CSS, animated with Framer Motion.
- Custom Web Audio stack for cues and transitions.
- Ships as a lightweight SPA so it loads instantly when you just need to start a session.
