## Project Overview

The Smart Directory UI project was centered around creating an interactive and intuitive user interface for 55-inch touchscreen displays positioned at key locations across urban environments. These directories are designed to serve as a digital hub for city navigation, providing residents and visitors with easy access to city maps, local services, points of interest, and a suite of applications tailored to enhance the urban experience.

## Challenges

### Balancing Stakeholder Demands with Design Integrity

Deploying the Smart Directory UI in cities involved navigating the interests of many stakeholders, from private entities managing local press to city employees overseeing public information. Each group wanted input on the content displayed, which required the interface to be highly customizable. This flexibility had to maintain a polished appearance, even when stakeholders made decisions that contradicted our recommendations. Balancing these diverse demands while preserving usability and aesthetic integrity was a significant challenge that shaped the design process.

## Solution

### A Robust, Accessible, and Adaptive Smart Directory UI

The final product is a Smart Directory UI featuring a highly responsive map interface with highly customizable app pages. It provides easy access to local services, events, and emergency information, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability or background, can navigate the city with ease. The interface dynamically adjusts to outdoor lighting conditions, ensuring visibility and usability at all times.

### Customizable Branding and Apps
Cities can personalize the UI with custom branding and app selection, all managed through an easy-to-use CMS.

### City Navigation and Points of Interest
The navigation app offers a detailed city map with unique Points of Interest (POIs), allowing users to search and receive directions to destinations around them. With walking, driving, public transit, and biking options, the app also integrates ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, providing comprehensive and adaptable routing options for seamless urban exploration.

## Conclusion + Lessons Learned

### What I’d do differently next time

This was my biggest project i'd ever taken from concept to market! 🎉 More than the actual output, however- I’m immensely grateful to have learned through process, and to be coached by my mentor through the times that I was stuck or felt like I had hit a wall.

**Research and apply what you’ve learned.** In the beginning stages, I’ve explored so many different options to try finding the right solution for the design. I tried so many time to “reinvent the wheel” when it came to kiosk software and looked past all of the years of research that had gone into it already.

**You didn’t fail- you just found 100 ways that didn’t work.** From noticing mistakes in my UI to uncovering more foundational UX problems in the software, I’m thankful to have constantly asked for feedback from my peers and my mentor Russ. In the end, I pushed to have the software as best I could, and did not let my own thinking stop me from questioning if my own decisions were truly best for the user.
