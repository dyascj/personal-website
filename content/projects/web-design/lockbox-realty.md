## Introduction

Lockbox Realty, a Cleveland-based real estate agency owned and operated by a husband-and-wife duo, specializes in serving Northern Ohio homebuyers and sellers. When they approached me, they needed a modern and professional website that balanced aesthetic appeal with practical functionality. Given the challenges and costs of working with an MLS service, the project required innovative solutions to deliver a feature-rich, user-friendly website on a tight two-week timeline.

## Challenges

This specific projects came with some challenges: 

**No MLS Provider Support:** The client’s MLS provider, the sole service available in their area, lacked any technical support, presenting a massive challenge. 

**Low Operational Costs:** Ensuring the website would remain cost-effective in the long run.

**Tight Deadline:** Completing a polished product within just two weeks.

## Key Features

The final Lockbox Realty website met all the client’s requirements:

### MLS Integration
